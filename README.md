# UpdateChecker-Testing
Testing my update checker cog

## Commit #1: The journey begins
So begins the journey of Neuro Assassin, to perfecting his updatechecker cog.  Will it turn out successfully, or will he be overcome by the forces of Python and die to its killing poison?  Only time will tell.

## Commit #2: The rest stop
I have reached a rest stop.  I was almost killed by UnboundLocalError, but alas, I prevailed!  I am adding a journal entry to rejoice of my win.  Until next time.

## Commit: Unsure
I am unsure of what commit I am at now.  Too many to count.
